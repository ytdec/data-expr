Population is based on the de facto definition of population, which counts all residents regardless of legal status or citizenship.","Derived from total population.

The growth rate is computed using the exponential growth formula:

r = ln(pn/p0)/n, 

where r is the exponential rate of growth, ln() is the natural logarithm, pn is the end period population, p0 is the beginning period population, and n is the number of years in between. Note that this is not the geometric growth rate used to compute compound growth over discrete periods.
